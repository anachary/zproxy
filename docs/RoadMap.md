# ZProxy Architecture Analysis and Implementation Plan

Thank you for sharing the ZProxy architecture document. This plan outlines how to implement the fastest reverse proxy based on the proposed architecture.

---

## üìä Architecture Analysis

The ZProxy architecture focuses on creating a high-performance reverse proxy with:

- **Multi-protocol support**: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, WebSocket
- **Flexible routing**: Path parameters, wildcards, method matching
- **Rule-based processing**: Authentication, rate limiting, caching
- **TLS support**: Certificate management, SNI
- **Concurrency model**: Thread-per-connection with thread pools
- **Extensibility**: Pluggable middleware, protocol handlers, configuration
