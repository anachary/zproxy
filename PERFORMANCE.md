# ZProxy Performance Optimizations

ZProxy has been optimized for maximum performance as a reverse proxy. This document outlines the key optimizations that make ZProxy one of the fastest reverse proxies available.

## Core Architecture Optimizations

### NUMA-Aware Thread Pool

ZProxy uses a NUMA-aware thread pool that optimizes performance on multi-socket systems by respecting memory locality and CPU affinity:

- **NUMA Node Detection**: Automatically detects NUMA topology
- **CPU Affinity**: Pins threads to specific CPUs to avoid context switching
- **Node-Local Memory**: Allocates memory on the same NUMA node as the processing thread
- **Per-Node Thread Pools**: Separate thread pools for each NUMA node
- **Lock-Free Job Queue**: Uses lock-free data structures for job distribution
- **Balanced Workload**: Distributes connections across NUMA nodes

### Memory Management

Efficient memory management is critical for high-performance proxying:

- **Vectored I/O Buffers**: Uses scatter/gather I/O for zero-copy data transfer
- **Zero-Copy Buffers**: Specialized buffer implementation that minimizes memory copies
- **NUMA-Aware Allocation**: Allocates memory on the same NUMA node as the processing thread
- **Buffer Pools**: Reuse memory buffers instead of allocating/freeing for each request
- **Arena Allocators**: Use arena allocators for request lifetime to reduce allocation overhead
- **Optimized Buffer Sizes**: Use larger buffers (64KB-256KB) for better throughput
- **Memory Alignment**: Ensure buffers are properly aligned for optimal CPU cache usage
- **Huge Pages**: Uses huge pages for large buffers to reduce TLB misses

### Connection Handling

Connection handling is optimized for both client and upstream connections:

- **Multi-Listener Architecture**: Uses SO_REUSEPORT for multiple listener sockets
- **Accept Spinning**: Optimized accept() loop for high-throughput scenarios
- **TCP Optimizations**: Disable Nagle's algorithm, enable TCP keep-alive
- **Socket Buffer Tuning**: Increase socket buffer sizes for higher throughput
- **Connection Pooling**: Maintain a pool of pre-established connections to upstream servers
- **Connection Reuse**: Keep connections alive for future requests
- **Pre-warming**: Pre-establish connections to upstream servers during initialization
- **Fast Connection Acquisition**: Optimized connection pool with fast path for connection acquisition
- **Connection Stealing**: Allows threads to steal connections from other threads when idle

## Protocol Optimizations

### HTTP/1.x

- **Efficient Parsing**: Minimize allocations during request parsing
- **Header Optimization**: Use string builders for efficient header construction
- **Chunked Transfer**: Optimized handling of chunked transfer encoding
- **Keep-Alive**: Support for HTTP keep-alive to reuse client connections

### HTTP/2

- **Multiplexing**: Efficiently handle multiple requests over a single connection
- **Stream Prioritization**: Prioritize important streams
- **Header Compression**: Use HPACK for efficient header compression
- **Flow Control**: Optimized flow control to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Concurrent Stream Processing**: Process multiple streams in parallel
- **Stream State Management**: Efficient tracking of stream states
- **Window Size Optimization**: Larger window sizes for better throughput
- **Frame Batching**: Batch small frames for better performance
- **Connection Reuse**: Keep HTTP/2 connections alive for future requests

### WebSocket

- **Zero-Copy Forwarding**: Forward WebSocket frames with minimal overhead
- **Frame Batching**: Batch small frames for better performance
- **Binary Processing**: Optimized binary frame handling

## Routing Optimizations

- **Trie-based Router**: O(k) routing where k is the path length (instead of O(n) where n is the number of routes)
- **Route Caching**: Cache route lookups for frequently accessed paths
- **Fast Path**: Optimized path for common routes
- **Method-specific Routing**: Separate tries for different HTTP methods

## Middleware Optimizations

- **Compile-time Middleware Chain**: Use compile-time composition for zero runtime overhead
- **Short-circuit Evaluation**: Skip unnecessary middleware processing
- **Middleware Ordering**: Order middleware for optimal performance (most rejecting first)

## Metrics and Monitoring

ZProxy includes built-in performance metrics:

- Request latency histograms
- Connection counts
- Bytes transferred
- Upstream response times
- Cache hit/miss ratios
